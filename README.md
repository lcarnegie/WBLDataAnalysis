# Women, Business, and the Law: A Case for Better Data Collection

## Overview of Paper

This self-directed research repo reproduces and builds on Hyland, Djankov, and Goldberg's paper "Gendered Laws and Women in the Workforce" published in the 2020 American Economic Review. 

## File Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

-   `input/data` contains the data sources used in analysis including the raw data.
-   `outputs/data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `outputs/paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.

## Reproducing Graphs and Tables 

Here is a quick guide to reproducing the graphs and tables.
1. Clone this repository to your computer
2. Download the data from the replication package folder
3. Clean it using data cleaning file in scripts
4. Open the paper.qmd file in outputs to test the R code that generated the plots
